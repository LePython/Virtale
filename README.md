# What is "Name of the collaboration project"?
Introduction...
 
 For the purpose of simplicity, the model can be also executed on the server. This saves the resources of your personal computer by sending a HTTP request to the server to download and then analyze the song. To receive the result of the analysis, you can also send a request to the server (??? correct me if I'm wrong). The song can then either be additionaly downloaded from the server along with the classified group number or the group number can be received without donwloading the song itself. Additionaly, if the song has already been downloaded once by someone, you can get the analyzed group almost instantly since it is saved on the server.
 
 For the showcase purposes, the program VirtaleVR was developed. It implements the machine learning models into its core funcionality by giving each song a different virtual environment created with help of Unity libraries. Note that the project won't be able to run without downloading/buying the required unity packages (You will get errors for missing packages). However, the scripts used for this project are free to use on your own projects, since they are virtually the same as the scripts on the main project page, but slightly more specificaly customized for the VR program. 

## Machine Learning

Anything Machine Learning related can be found under the [ML model training](https://github.com/LePython/VirtaleVR/wiki/ML-model-training) page.

## Server

The classification is done on the server. You can find all details to that in [wiki](https://github.com/LePython/VirtaleVR/wiki/Server)

## Unity Scripts

## Etc.
