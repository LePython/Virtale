# What is "Name of the collaboration project"?
VirtaleVR is a virtual reality program built on top of the Machine Learning algorithm K-Means-Clustering. The ML algorithm analyses the given song and puts it into the similar group to the other analyzed songs. This way you can group any song with mathematical similarities together. It is not the same as grouping the songs with the same genre together!

 The intention behind this project is to combine Machine Learning with new technologies alike (VR in this case). Since most projects on the internet are focused on the ML models and their training, this project is intended to show both the model and its implementation in a Unity project.
 
 For the purpose of simplicity, the model can be also executed on the server. This saves the resources of your personal computer by sending a HTTP request to the server to download and then analyze the song. To receive the result of the analysis, you can also send a request to the server (??? correct me if I'm wrong). The song can then either be additionaly downloaded from the server along with the classified group number or the group number can be received without donwloading the song itself. Additionaly, if the song has already been downloaded once by someone, you can get the analyzed group almost instantly since it is saved on the server.

## Machine Learning
Anything Machine Learning related can be found under the [ML model training](https://github.com/LePython/VirtaleVR/wiki/ML-model-training) page.
## Server
The classification is done on the server. You can find all details to that in [wiki](https://github.com/LePython/VirtaleVR/wiki/Server)
## Unity Scripts
## Etc.


***
**Note:** The Unity project won't be able to run without downloading/buying the required unity packages (You will get errors for missing packages). However, the scripts used for this project are free to use on your own projects.
