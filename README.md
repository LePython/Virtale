# What is VirtaleVR?
For the showcase purposes, the program VirtaleVR was developed. It implements the machine learning models into its core funcionality by giving each song a different virtual environment created with help of Unity libraries. Note that the project won't be able to run without downloading/buying the required unity packages (You will get errors for missing packages). However, the scripts used for this project are free to use on your own projects, since they are virtually the same as the scripts on the main project page, but slightly more specificaly customized for the VR program. 

 The intention behind this project is to combine Machine Learning with new technologies alike (VR in this case). Since most projects on the internet are focused on the ML models and their training, this project is intended to show both the model and its implementation in a Unity project which is almost commercially ready. The problem of publishing it in a oculus app store is that Leap Motion sensor is used to control everything inside the program. To publish it, a big part of the project would need to be rewritten for interactions with the Oculus Controllers.
